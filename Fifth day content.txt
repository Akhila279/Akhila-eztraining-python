FUNCTIONS:

Classifications:
predefined
user defined


For code reusability we want to use a particular function for multiple times in our program instead of writting the same code multiple
times we can write it once include that inside a function
and can call the function wherever we need it 

Types:
1)Functions without argument without return value
2)without argument with return
3)with argument and without return
4)with argument and with return
