polymorphism:
one item or same item used for different purpose
Types:
1)Overloading
  a)operator overloading
     Ex:5+10=15 we will just add the numbers
        "5"+"10"=510 in this case it is concatenation
  b)method overloading
2)overriding:If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base class or parent class

DATA STRUCTURES:
Two types:
 linear datastructure:-storing data sequentially
  Ex:Array/linked list/stack/queue/matrix
 non-linear datastructure:-no sequential style required
  ex:binary tree/heap/hash function/graph


static:which cannot be changed i.e.,size
ex:Array
Dynamic:which is changeable
ex:list,stack,queue

LINKED LIST:
realtime example:Train
As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list
Types:
1)single linked list
2)double linked list
3)circular linked list

CREATING LINKED LIST:
STEP 1:Create the node
STEP 2:Partition the node with two segments data and none
STEP 3:Add value into the blank node
STEP 4:Mark th node as head
STEP 5:create the next node by following tha above steps
STEP 6:Establish link between first node and the next node

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST:
Traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list
